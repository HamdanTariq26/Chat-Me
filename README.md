# LAN Chat App with File Transfer (C++ / ASIO)

## Overview

**Chat Me** is a C++ client–server application that enables real-time text messaging and file transfer over a local network. The project demonstrates asynchronous networking, message handling, multithreading, and serialization using ASIO, while emphasizing practical understanding of client–server architectures.

This project was developed as part of a university team assignment, with most implementation done individually. It integrates knowledge from networking theory with hands-on coding experience.

## Learning & Implementation

- The networking foundation was implemented by coding alongside the MMO Client/Server Framework tutorials by David Barr (javidx9).  
- Code was written in parallel with the tutorial, with active debugging and understanding of each component.  
- The framework was adapted to support LAN-based chat and file transfer, including multiple client connections and reliable message delivery.  
- Tutorial-derived files retain the **OLC-3 license**, while original project files are authored by **Hamdan** under **Apache License 2.0**.
